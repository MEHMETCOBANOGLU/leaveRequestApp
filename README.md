## Project Overview

The leave tracking application we are developing is designed to streamline the leave management process for employees and enable managers to efficiently manage leave requests. The application is being developed using Flutter.

### Key Features

- **Login and Authorization System:** Users can access the application through a secure login screen with authorization. Both employees and managers can log into their accounts and manage their leave requests.

- **Department-Based Leave Management:** Employees' department information is recorded, and leave requests are routed to the relevant department managers. This feature facilitates direct communication between employees and their department managers.

- **Leave Request Details:** Employees can specify the number of leave days, the reason for the leave, and other necessary details via a form within the application. The information is then displayed in the leave section of the admin's page, where the admin can approve or deny the request. A message button is also available for communication.

- **Employee-Admin Communication:** Employees can communicate with department managers about their leave requests through a chat section. Managers can quickly evaluate requests and interact with employees as needed.

- **User Activation:** Admins can assign usernames and passwords to registered users through the user activation page, providing them with the necessary credentials to access the system.
